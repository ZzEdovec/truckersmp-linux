# 🚛 TruckersMP Launcher For Linux
## ❓ What is it?
In fact, this is a graphical wrapper over the [truckersmp-cli](https://github.com/truckersmp-cli/truckersmp-cli).
Dynamic  updates are implemented  here  - the game/mod is updated  only  when  it  really  needs to be updated.  This  means  that  you don't  have to wait a few  minutes  every  time  before  starting the game.
#### ❕ Notice
This is only the first version of the launcher. It may contain errors and flaws. For example, there is no support for multi language, event tabs, server status, and auto-update of the launcher yet. **If you find a bug or need any features, open the [issue](https://github.com/ZzEdovec/truckersmp-linux/issues).**

## ⬇️ Installing
Download latest release from [releases](https://github.com/ZzEdovec/truckersmp-linux/releases) and execute the downloaded file (`chmod +x` may be required)
#### ‼️ Dependency notice
The launcher will not be able to work with the game without the system-wide installed [truckersmp-cli](https://github.com/truckersmp-cli/truckersmp-cli#install).
